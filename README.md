# to-do-list-gui
This project allows the user to create a persistent To-Do list. When creating new items, the user must specify a label for the item/task and a date. When marking an item as in progress, the user will need to click the item they wish to start, and specify the date of which it was started.  When marking an item as completed, the process is similar, though excluding the need for a date. The following operations may be conducted in the GUI:  
- Create a new task  
- Mark an item as started  
- Mark an item as completed  
- List the items currently in the list  
- Sort items by date or name  
- Display a specific set of items (i.e. started, or completed items)  
- Remove completed items  
- Save To-Do list on exit
